## 介紹 Dirty read, unrepeatable read, phantom problem

### 1. Dirty read 髒讀
A dirty read (aka uncommitted dependency) occurs when a transaction retrieves a row that has been updated by another transaction that is not yet committed.
(事務a 可以查到尚未被commit的數據)

### 2. Non-repeatable reads 不可重複讀
A non-repeatable read occurs when a transaction retrieves a row twice and that row is updated by another transaction that is committed in between.
The A row that user A has queried has a **different value** the second time.
(同一個row 第一次查出來的數字與第二次查出的數字不相同)

### 3. Phantom reads 幻讀
A phantom read occurs when a transaction retrieves a set of rows twice and new rows are inserted into or removed from that set by another transaction that is committed in between.
 All the rows in the query have the **same value** before and after, but **different rows** are being selecte(because B has deleted or inserted some). Example: select sum(x) from table; will return a different result even if none of the affected rows themselves have been updated, if rows have been added or deleted.
(同一個select語法，第一次查出來的結果與第二次查出來的結果不一樣，例如: 第一次查到10條，第二次卻查到 14條)
